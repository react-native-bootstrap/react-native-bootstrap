## React-Native-Bootstrap

> [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) components built for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

The idea behind is similar to [`react-bootstrap`](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap), to write Bootstrap component for React Native. This is just the inception of the project, I haven't done anything like this, if you have knowledge and want to collaborate please help.

## Meanwhile please use

- [React Native Elements](https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements)
